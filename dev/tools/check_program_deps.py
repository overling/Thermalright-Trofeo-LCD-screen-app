"""Check every way we ship against what each target ACTUALLY provides.

A UNIVERSAL dependency check: every hard dependency x every shipping target.
Not "distros" -- we ship six ways, and they use THREE different models:

    target        deps come from              can drift?
    ------------  --------------------------  ----------
    Arch          pacman `depend =`           YES - hand-declared
    deb           apt `Depends:`              YES - hand-declared
    rpm (Fedora)  dnf `Requires:` + vendored  YES - hand-declared
    deb (legacy)  pip, in its own venv        no  - resolved from pyproject
    Windows       pip install ".[...]"        no  - resolved from pyproject
    macOS         pip install ".[...]"        no  - resolved from pyproject

Only the hand-declared three can silently omit something; the pip-resolved three
take the wheel as their source of truth. So each cell asks one of two questions,
never one blanket rule.

Packaging carries frozen claims about the outside world:

    # Bundle sounddevice + nvidia-ml-py (neither in Fedora repos)
    optdepend = python-nvidia-ml-py: NVIDIA GPU sensor support

Both were true when written.  Both rot, because distro repos change and nobody
re-reads a comment.  When `nvidia-ml-py` became a hard dependency to fix "no
NVIDIA GPU sensors" (#207, #161), the Arch spec kept it as an *optdepend* — so
pacman never installed it and the fix reached Arch/CachyOS users as nothing at
all, while we told the reporter it was fixed.  Nothing re-checked, and the
packaging job only runs on a tag push, so there was no moment where it surfaced.

Two halves, deliberately split:

* ``tests/test_packaging_entrypoints.py`` — OFFLINE, runs every push.  Catches
  *our* drift: a hard pyproject dep not declared in a distro spec.
* this tool — ONLINE, run before a release.  Catches *the distro's* drift:
  packages appearing or vanishing under us.  It cannot be a test — tests must
  stay offline and deterministic.

Run:  python3 dev/tools/check_distro_deps.py
Exit: 0 = every claim still true, 1 = at least one claim has rotted.
