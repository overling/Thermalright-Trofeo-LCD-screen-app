# Development Status

TRCC Linux is **feature-complete** — all 45 features from the Windows TRCC 2.1.2 have been ported, with full CLI/GUI/API parity via hexagonal architecture.

**Current version:** 9.3.3
**Branch:** `main`
**Tests:** 5603 across 102 files in 9 hexagonal directories
**PyPI:** [trcc-linux](https://pypi.org/project/trcc-linux/)

## What's Stable

All features are tested and working on the `main` branch:

- **6 protocol backends** — SCSI, HID, LED, Bulk (raw USB), LY (bulk), IPC (Unix socket)
- **Full GUI** — local/cloud/mask themes, overlays, video playback, carousel, image cropper, video trimmer
- **System info overlays** — 77+ sensors (CPU, GPU, RAM, disk, network, fans)
- **LED RGB control** — 6 effect modes (Static, Breathing, Colorful, Rainbow, Temp-linked, Load-linked), sensor-linked colors, 12 device styles
- **Per-device config** — each LCD remembers its theme, brightness, rotation, overlay, and carousel settings
- **Autostart** — launches minimized to system tray on login, sends last-used theme
- **Setup wizard** — CLI (`trcc setup`) and GUI (`trcc setup-gui`)
- **CLI** — 95 Typer commands with full service parity (theme, LED, display, overlay, screencast, video, diagnostics, setup, i18n), grouped into 7 help panels
- **REST API** — 78 endpoints with full CLI parity (`trcc serve`), Pydantic models, uses LCDDevice/LEDDevice from core/
- **IPC daemon** — GUI owns device exclusively; CLI auto-routes through Unix socket when GUI is running
- **Services layer** — 8 pure-Python service classes shared by GUI, CLI, and API
- **Cross-distro compatibility** — tested on Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu, Arch, openSUSE, Void, Alpine, Gentoo, NixOS, SteamOS, Bazzite
- **5603 tests** across 102 test files in hexagonal directory layout (`tests/{core,services,adapters/,cli,api,gui}/`)
