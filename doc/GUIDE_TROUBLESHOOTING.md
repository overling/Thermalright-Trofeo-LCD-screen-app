## `trcc: command not found`

**Cause:** `pip install` puts the `trcc` script in `~/.local/bin/`, which isn't in your shell's `PATH` on many distros.

**Fix:** Open a **new terminal**, or add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH permanently:

```bash
# Bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

# Zsh (Arch, Garuda, some Manjaro)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc

# Fish
fish_add_path ~/.local/bin
```

| Distro | `~/.local/bin` in PATH by default? |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Fedora | Yes |
| Ubuntu / Debian | Conditionally (only if dir exists at login) |
| Arch / Manjaro / EndeavourOS | No |
| openSUSE | No |
| Void / Alpine | No |

---

## Old pip/pipx install shadows the system package

**Cause:** You previously installed TRCC via pip or pipx, then switched to a native package (`.deb`, `.rpm`, `.pkg.tar.zst`). The old `~/.local/bin/trcc` takes priority over `/usr/bin/trcc`, so you're running the old version — or it fails because the old venv is broken.

**Symptoms:** Wrong version, missing modules, or strange errors after upgrading to a native package.

**Fix:**

```bash
# Remove the old pip/pipx install
pipx uninstall trcc-linux 2>/dev/null
rm -f ~/.local/bin/trcc

# Verify the system package is being used
which trcc    # should show /usr/bin/trcc
trcc --version
```

---

## No compatible TRCC LCD device detected

**Cause:** The LCD isn't showing up as a SCSI device.

**Fix:**
1. Make sure the USB cable is plugged in (both ends)
2. Run udev setup: `trcc system setup`
3. **Unplug and replug the USB cable** (or reboot)
4. Check if the device appears: `ls /dev/sg*`
5. Check kernel messages: `dmesg | tail -20` right after plugging in

> **HID devices** (0416:5302, 0418:5303, 0418:5304, 0416:8001) don't use `/dev/sg*`. Use `trcc detect --all` instead.

---

## Permission denied when accessing the device

**Cause:** Udev rules not set up, or stale rules from an older version.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Upgrade to latest version first
pip install --upgrade trcc-linux

# Re-generate udev rules
trcc system setup

# Unplug/replug USB cable, or reboot
```

### SELinux / Immutable Distros

**Affects:** Bazzite, Fedora Silverblue, Fedora Kinoite, Aurora, Bluefin, and any SELinux-enforcing distro.

Versions before v1.2.16 used `TAG+="uaccess"` in udev rules, which relies on systemd-logind ACLs. **SELinux blocks these ACLs**, so the device stays root-only even after `trcc system setup`.

**Symptoms:**
- `ls -la /dev/sgX` shows `crw-rw----. 1 root root` (no ACL `+` marker)
- `getenforce` returns `Enforcing`
- Device works with `sudo` but not as regular user

**Fix:** Upgrade to v1.2.16+ which uses `MODE="0666"`:
```bash
pip install --upgrade trcc-linux
sudo trcc system setup
# Unplug/replug USB cable
```

**Verify:** After replug, check permissions:
```bash
ls -la /dev/sg*
# Should show: crw-rw-rw- (world-readable/writable)
```

### Bulk Device EBUSY on SELinux

**Affects:** Bulk USB devices (87AD:70DB — GrandVision 360, Mjolnir Vision, Wonder Vision Pro 360) on SELinux-enforcing distros (Bazzite, Silverblue, Fedora Atomic).

**Symptoms:**
- `[Errno 16] Resource busy` in handshake/frame send
- `detach_kernel_driver()` silently blocked by SELinux
- Device works on non-SELinux distros but fails on Bazzite

**Fix (v4.2.0+):**
```bash
pip install --upgrade trcc-linux
trcc system setup    # installs SELinux policy module (auto-elevates with sudo)
# Unplug/replug USB cable
trcc report           # verify handshake succeeds
```

If `checkmodule` is not found:
```bash
sudo dnf install checkpolicy    # Fedora/Bazzite
```

---

## PySide6 Issues

### "Error: PySide6 not available"

**Fix:** Install for your distro:
```bash
# Fedora
sudo dnf install python3-pyside6

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install python3-pyside6

# Arch
sudo pacman -S python-pyside6

# Or via pip as fallback
pip install PySide6
```

### Segmentation fault (core dumped)

**Cause:** Most commonly, a missing Qt6 xcb dependency. On Ubuntu/Mint, `libxcb-cursor0` is not installed by default but Qt6 requires it — without it, Qt segfaults silently on startup.

**Fix 1 — Install missing library** (try this first):
```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0
```

**Fix 2 — Use a virtual environment** (if Fix 1 doesn't help):
```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.local/share/trcc-venv
~/.local/share/trcc-venv/bin/pip install trcc-linux
~/.local/share/trcc-venv/bin/trcc gui
```

**Diagnostic:** If neither fix works:
```bash
# Show Qt plugin loading errors
QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1 trcc gui 2>&1 | head -30
```

---

## HID Device Issues

### "No HID devices found"

1. Verify USB connection: `lsusb | grep -i "0416\|0418\|87"`
2. Run `trcc system setup` and unplug/replug
3. Check if another process holds the USB device (VM, Windows TRCC in dual-boot)

### "Handshake returned None (protocol error)"

The device was detected but didn't respond to the handshake query. Common causes:

1. **Old version** — v1.2.9 rewrote the HID handshake with retry logic, 5s timeout, and endpoint auto-detect. Upgrade first:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade trcc-linux
   ```
2. **Firmware consumed the handshake** — some devices only respond once per USB power cycle. Unplug the USB header, wait 5 seconds, replug, then immediately run `trcc system hid-debug`
3. **Unknown device** — if the device model isn't in our mapping table, [open an issue](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/issues) with the `trcc system hid-debug` output

### "No USB backend available"

**Fix:** Install pyusb:
```bash
pip install pyusb

# Also need the system library:
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev    # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install libusb1-devel       # Fedora
sudo pacman -S libusb                # Arch
```

### HID "Permission denied"

See [Permission denied](#permission-denied-when-accessing-the-device) above — same fix applies. Make sure you're on v1.2.16+ for SELinux compatibility.

### GUI shows empty themes with HID device

Themes are resolution-specific. If the handshake failed, the app doesn't know your screen resolution, so it can't load the right theme pack. Fix the handshake first — themes will populate automatically once the resolution is detected.

---

## Sensors & GPU metrics

### GPU readings are empty / "No NVIDIA GPU detected"

NVIDIA GPU metrics use the NVML python bindings (`nvidia-ml-py`, imported as `pynvml`). **As of v9.8.3 this is a core dependency** — every install channel (pip, pipx, the distro packages, the frozen builds) ships it, so GPU metrics work out of the box with no separate install and no prompt to accept. It's pure-Python and does nothing on machines without an NVIDIA card.

If GPU readings are still empty on a current version, it's almost always the NVIDIA **driver**, not the reader: check `nvidia-smi` runs, and if it reports a version mismatch, reboot (or reload the driver module). Only if you're on an **older install that predates v9.8.3** — or an environment that deliberately stripped the dependency — would you need to add the reader into trcc's own interpreter:

```bash
# pip / venv install — install into the running interpreter
pip install nvidia-ml-py
```

Then **restart trcc** — `pynvml` is imported once at startup, so a freshly installed reader only takes effect on the next launch.

AMD and Intel GPU temperatures come from `hwmon` and need no extra package.

### CPU power shows blank / `--`

CPU package power is read from the kernel's RAPL energy counter, which is **root-only on most distros** (a side-channel mitigation), so the reading comes back empty. Grant read access (and load the counter's kernel module) with:

```bash
trcc system setup
```

This works the same on AMD (Zen) and Intel — the counter lives at the vendor-agnostic `intel-rapl` node either way. To see what's going on, `trcc report` now includes a **CPU power (RAPL)** section showing whether the counter exists and is readable.

## Display Issues

### LCD stays blank or shows old image

```bash
trcc reset
```

### GUI looks wrong / elements overlapping

**Cause:** HiDPI scaling interfering with the fixed-size layout.

```bash
QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0 trcc gui
```

### Colors are wrong (red/blue swapped)

**Cause:** RGB565 byte order mismatch. Different protocols and resolutions use different byte orders (big-endian vs little-endian). Fixed in v5.0.8 for HID Type 2 devices. Upgrade:

```bash
pip install --upgrade trcc-linux
```

If the issue persists after upgrading, do a clean reinstall:
```bash
trcc uninstall
pip install trcc-linux
trcc system setup
```

If colors are still wrong, [open an issue](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/issues) with `trcc report` output.

### Device detected but nothing displays / sg_raw errors

**Cause:** UAS (USB Attached SCSI) kernel driver interferes with LCD devices.

**Fix:** Verify the USB quirk file exists:
```bash
cat /etc/modprobe.d/trcc-lcd.conf
```

If missing, recreate:
```bash
trcc system setup
# Unplug/replug or reboot
```

If the problem persists, manually blacklist UAS:
```bash
echo "options usb-storage quirks=87cd:70db:u,0416:5406:u,0402:3922:u" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/trcc-lcd.conf
sudo dracut --force       # Fedora/RHEL
# or
sudo update-initramfs -u  # Debian/Ubuntu
```

---

## Video / Media Issues

### Video/GIF playback not working

**Cause:** FFmpeg not installed.

```bash
# Fedora / Nobara
sudo dnf install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Arch / CachyOS / Garuda
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

### Screen cast shows black on Wayland

**Cause:** GNOME/KDE Wayland require PipeWire portal for screen capture.

```bash
# Fedora
sudo dnf install python3-gobject python3-dbus pipewire-devel

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install python3-gi python3-dbus python3-gst-1.0

# Arch
sudo pacman -S python-gobject python-dbus python-gst
```

> Screen cast works automatically on X11 and wlroots-based compositors (Sway, Hyprland). PipeWire portal is only needed for GNOME and KDE Wayland.

---

## NixOS-Specific

### `trcc system setup` doesn't work

NixOS manages udev rules declaratively. Add rules to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`:

```nix
services.udev.extraRules = ''
  # SCSI LCD devices
  SUBSYSTEM=="scsi_generic", ATTRS{idVendor}=="87cd", ATTRS{idProduct}=="70db", MODE="0666"
  SUBSYSTEM=="scsi_generic", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0416", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5406", MODE="0666"
  SUBSYSTEM=="scsi_generic", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0402", ATTRS{idProduct}=="3922", MODE="0666"
  # Bulk USB devices
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="87ad", ATTR{idProduct}=="70db", MODE="0666"
  # HID LCD/LED devices
  SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0416", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5302", MODE="0666"
  SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0418", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5303", MODE="0666"
  SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0418", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5304", MODE="0666"
  SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0416", ATTRS{idProduct}=="8001", MODE="0666"
'';
```

Then rebuild: `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`

## Quick Diagnostic

Run the setup wizard to check all dependencies at once:

```bash
trcc system setup        # CLI — shows all checks with install prompts
trcc setup-gui    # GUI — visual check panel with Install buttons
```

---

## Still Stuck?

1. Run `trcc report` and copy the full output
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/issues) with the report
3. Include your distro, kernel version (`uname -r`), and what you've tried
