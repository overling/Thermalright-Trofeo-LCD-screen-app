"""Concrete ``Diagnostics`` port — wraps the diagnostics functions.

The health/doctor/debug-report/gpu-reader logic already lives as module-level
functions that consume the ``Platform`` port.  This adapter binds them to one
platform instance and exposes them through the core ``Diagnostics`` ABC, so core
Commands + the quickstart service depend on the port, never on these modules.

The probe functions are called **module-qualified** (``_health.foo()``) rather
than imported by name so a test can ``monkeypatch.setattr`` the module attribute
and have the adapter see it — the attribute resolves at call time.
