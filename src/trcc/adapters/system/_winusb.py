"""Windows WinUSB driver diagnostic + setup instructions.

The Windows analog of the Linux ``_udev.py`` and FreeBSD ``_devd.py``
installers — but Windows can't silently install kernel drivers without
elevation and a signed driver package.  So this module's job is
**diagnose the state and give the user copy-paste-ready instructions**.

What's actually needed
----------------------
For pyusb / libusb to talk to a TRCC device on Windows, the device's
USB interface must be bound to ``WinUSB.sys`` (or ``libusbK``,
``libusb-win32``).  Windows' default behaviour for a generic USB
device is to bind it to no driver at all (or the wrong one), so libusb
fails with ``NoBackendError`` until the user runs Zadig — see
https://zadig.akeo.ie/ — to swap the driver to WinUSB.

This wizard:

  1. Tries to enumerate every device in the registry via pyusb.
  2. For each device that is **physically present but invisible to
     pyusb**, prints a one-liner naming exactly which device needs
     WinUSB and a Zadig command sequence the user can paste.
  3. Returns 0 if every present device is visible, 1 if any need
     driver work, 2 if pyusb itself isn't usable (libusb-1.0.dll
     missing from PATH — separate fix).

Zero side effects.  Read-only diagnostic.
