#     → Command persists + invalidates scene + publishes event
#     → THIS observer subscribes to the event
#     → dispatches RenderAndSend

#     → preview widget (separate observer via bus_bridge) consumes FrameSent

# observers of the same composited frame.  This class is the bridge
# that turns "settings changed" into "frame composited" — without it
# the composite never rebuilds for static themes and the click is
