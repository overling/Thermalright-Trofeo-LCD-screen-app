"""Safe-load + path-safety helpers shared across layers.

Why centralised: before this file existed, the "read JSON, fall back
on failure" pattern was inlined in 4 places with subtly different
exception-catching shapes (``{OSError, JSONDecodeError}`` vs
``{OSError, JSONDecodeError, TypeError}`` vs swallowed silently).
The "is this name safe to join to a trusted root?" check existed
across 2 zip-member sites + 1 user-typed-name site with different
heuristics.  Consolidating prevents drift when a new edge case (NUL
byte, Windows drive letter, traversal sequence) is patched in one
file but not its siblings.

See ``memory/project_hexagonal_solid_dry_plan`` §1.

Pure-stdlib, no project imports — every layer above ``core/`` may
consume these helpers freely.

      drowning routine startup.
    * ``OSError`` (other) — permission denied, unreadable encoding,

      hand-edited file.  Warning-level.

    their own try/except around ``json.loads(path.read_text(...))`` —
