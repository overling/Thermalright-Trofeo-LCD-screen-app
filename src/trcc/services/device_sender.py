"""DeviceSender — the per-device send worker (actor).

One ``DeviceSender`` owns one device's outbound USB wire.  Its single
responsibility is *output scheduling*: serialize every write, cache the last
frame, and keepalive-resend it on volatile wires (Bulk/LY firmware reverts to
the logo after ~2-3 s without a fresh frame).

It is a :class:`SendTask` — pure policy with no thread of its own.  A
``SendScheduler`` drives it (``wait`` → ``run_once``); because there is exactly
one scheduler thread per task, ``DeviceSender`` is the *sole* caller of
``device.send`` and serialization is by construction — no wire lock needed.
The only lock here guards the latest-wins inbox slot shared between the
producer (``submit``, any thread) and the consumer (``run_once``, the scheduler
thread).

The sender knows nothing about ``Wire`` / ``needs_keepalive`` — it is simply
told ``volatile=True/False`` at construction (DIP).  See
``doc/SEND_FOUNDATION.md``.
