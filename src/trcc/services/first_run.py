"""First-run detection — was this the first time trcc started on this user's machine?

Used by the GUI to surface a welcome / setup flow only on the first
launch, and by the CLI's ``status`` to remind users about the doctor
if they haven't run it.

State is a single marker file under ``Paths.config_dir()``:
``.first-run-done``.  Empty file — its presence is the signal.
Wiping ``trcc.json`` doesn't re-trigger first-run by design (a
user's settings reset shouldn't replay the onboarding wizard); deleting
the marker file specifically does.

Why a service rather than a function: gives tests a clean seam
(``service.mark_completed()`` or ``service.reset()``) and keeps the
filesystem call behind one wrapper.
