"""MetricsLoop — periodic sensor broadcast.

Legacy ran a ``PollingMetricsLoop`` thread that every
``refresh_interval_s`` polled the OS sensors and published
``Topic.METRICS`` so subscribers (system info widget, activity
sidebar, LCD overlay, LED render) saw fresh readings on a single
cadence.

next/ ships the per-OS sensor enumerator (``platform.sensors()``)
and the ``SensorsUpdated`` event class, but the bridge that turns
"the aggregator's dict refreshed" into "fire ``SensorsUpdated`` on
the bus" was missing.  Result: ``bus_bridge.sensors_updated.connect``
subscribers in the GUI (``TRCCApp._on_bus_sensors_updated`` →
``uc_system_info`` / ``uc_activity_sidebar``) waited forever for an
event that never arrived.

This service is the missing chokepoint.  Owns one daemon thread.
Reads ``settings.app.refresh_interval_s`` per iteration so a control-
center change to "Refresh every Ns" takes effect on the next sleep.
