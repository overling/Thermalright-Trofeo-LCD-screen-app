"""QuickstartService — guided first-run flow for new users.

What it does, in plain language:

1. Runs the doctor.  If any FAIL, stops and tells the user what to fix.
2. Runs `system setup` if udev rules are missing on Linux.
3. Scans for devices.
4. If found, attempts a handshake (connect) on the first one.
5. Pushes a small "success" frame (solid green) so the user sees their
   screen change — the strongest signal that "yes, this works."

Each step writes a structured line into the result so any UI (CLI,
GUI, API) can render the same sequence.  Step boundaries are explicit
so the GUI can show progress per step instead of a single spinner.

Why a service: keeps the orchestration honest.  The CLI doesn't have
to thread together doctor + scan + connect + send_color and get the
order wrong; it just dispatches one Command and renders steps.
