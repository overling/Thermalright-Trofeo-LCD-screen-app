"""GUI composition root for next/ — wires Qt adapter.

Single entry point for the graphical interface.  Builds the windowed
``QApplication`` (which Qt requires before any QWidget), constructs an
``App`` via ``trcc._boot.trcc()``, then hands the app handle
to ``MainWindow``.  ``discover`` runs in a background ``BootstrapWorker``
so the splash shows immediate feedback.

Composition root — this is the ONE place that imports concrete adapters
(``Platform``, ``QtRenderer``, ``IPCServer``, ``SingleInstance``).  Every
other file under ``next/ui/gui/`` holds an ``App`` handle and dispatches
Commands.

    the SAME code the real app runs (the whole reason to mock: real code
    paths surface real bugs).  Callers differ only in what ``platform`` they
    build and these seams:

      * ``single_instance`` — acquire the cross-process GUI lock (off for the

        avoid socket collision).

        pynvml can outlive ``qapp.exec()``); the dev mock returns normally.
