"""Preview + device orientation geometry — toolkit-free, for the LCD View.

The orientation-driven sizes a device View needs are pure geometry:

  * :func:`composed_preview_size` — the preview bezel/label dims for the active
    theme (the DisplayService's composed canvas when a theme + profile resolve,
    else the cached canvas swapped for the user orientation, #136).
  * :func:`rotated_lcd_size` — the post-rotation LCD buffer size + the
    is-rotated flag the theme/mask catalogs and preview key off.

Both used to live inline in ``LCDHandler`` (``_composed_preview_size`` /
``_sync_rotation_state``), each hand-rolling the orientation swap that core's
``oriented_resolution`` already owns.  Lifting them leaves the handler a thin
View and makes the rules unit-testable with no Qt — routed through the single
``oriented_resolution`` helper.
