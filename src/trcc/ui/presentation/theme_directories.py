"""Theme-directory resolution — toolkit-free, for the LCD device View.

The per-resolution browser directories (local themes, user themes, cloud
backgrounds, cloud masks) + the catalog dims a device's theme/mask/cutter
panels are pointed at are a pure function of the device's geometry: its
pre-rotation canvas size, its post-rotation LCD size, and whether the user
rotated it.  That logic — including the #136 portrait-fallback rule (a rotated
device with no portrait theme dir on disk browses the landscape dir, while its
cloud/mask catalogs stay portrait) — used to live inline in
``LCDHandler._update_theme_directories``, untestable without a QWidget.

Lifting it here leaves the handler a thin View (resolve → poke widgets) and
makes the dims-selection + fallback rules unit-testable against a fake ``Paths``
with zero Qt.  The heavier first-install auto-load (an ``iterdir`` walk that
dispatches a theme load) stays in the View — that FS walk belongs behind a
repository port, a later increment.
