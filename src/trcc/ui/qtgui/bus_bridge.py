"""EventBus ↔ Qt signals adapter.

EventBus calls are synchronous and may arrive from any thread (sensor
poller, device worker, etc.).  Qt widgets must update on the main
thread.  This bridge subscribes a single handler per event type and
re-emits each event as a Qt signal, which widgets connect to with
`Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection` to marshal onto the main thread.
