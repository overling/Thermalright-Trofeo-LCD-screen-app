"""A device-connect failure carries the per-OS hint to BOTH channels.

The reason a connect failed (e.g. "run as administrator") is sourced from
the DI'd ``platform.check_permissions()`` and rides out on the sync
``ConnectResult`` AND the ``ErrorOccurred`` event — so every UI can show
*why* the panel stayed blank instead of failing silently.
