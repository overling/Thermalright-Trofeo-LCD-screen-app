"""Every cooler in the catalog handshakes + resolves geometry — one test each.

The registry's ``VariantOverride`` table is the real device catalog: one USB
vid:pid fronts many coolers told apart by the handshake PM/SUB return bytes.
This parametrizes over EVERY distinct cooler variant (plus the registry devices
that carry no variant table) and drives the REAL ``ConnectDevice`` path with a
faithfully-scripted handshake (``MockPlatform``), so every device the app
claims to support is proven on every CI run — no guessing whether a reporter's
panel works.

Wire transport lifecycle (send/close/resume) is covered per vid:pid by
``dev/smoke_device_matrix.py``; this is the per-variant GEOMETRY layer.
