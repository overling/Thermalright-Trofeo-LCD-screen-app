"""Integration smoke under pytest — runs the same matrix as
``dev/smoke_full_pipeline.py`` so CI catches integration regressions
without anyone having to remember to invoke the dev script.

This test is the unified-UI contract in code: every UI on top of
next/ (CLI / API / GUI / future VR) builds Command objects and
dispatches them on App.  If the Command bus + EventBus carry the
traffic for every Command family here, every UI inherits the same
behavior.
