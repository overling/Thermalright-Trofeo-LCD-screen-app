"""Guard: the distro packaging file-lists must match ``[project.scripts]``.

The Linux release hardcodes the console-script binary names in two places — the
RPM ``%files`` list and the DEB ``postinst``/``prerm`` wrapper loops.  When the
entry points changed at the next→root cutover (``trcc-detect`` / ``trcc-test`` /
``trcc-next`` removed), ``release.yml`` was NOT updated, so the RPM build failed
with ``File not found: /usr/bin/trcc-detect`` — and it went unnoticed for two
releases (v9.7.0, v9.7.1) because the packaging job only runs on a TAG push,
never on regular CI.

This test runs in the normal suite (every push / PR), so the drift is caught the
moment someone touches ``[project.scripts]`` — not silently at the next release.
