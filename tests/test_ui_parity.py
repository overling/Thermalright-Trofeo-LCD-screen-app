"""UI parity gate — the CLI and API must dispatch the same Commands.

The four UIs are one app wearing four faces (see ``METHOD_UI.md``): a user
capability is ONE core Command, dispatched identically by every UI.  This pins
the CLI ↔ API Command surface — the two complete programmatic UIs — so a
Command wired into one but not the other FAILS here, forcing the author to
either reach parity or record the asymmetry with a reason.  That structurally
kills the "one UI forgot" class of bug (#150 was exactly that).

Scope: CLI ↔ API only.  GUI/qtgui dispatch Commands through interactive
handlers rather than top-level imports, so their reachability needs a dynamic
collector — a future gate, noted here rather than silently omitted.
